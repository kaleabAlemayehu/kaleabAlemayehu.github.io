Hey, I’m Kaleab who’s endlessly curious about how things work, especially when it comes to computers. I’m passionate about Linux and could easily spend hours talking about it. I enjoy building things that catch my interest, whether it’s a project to solve a problem or exploring the deeper, more technical side of how systems and software operate.

For me, it’s all about digging under the hood and understanding the details while creating something meaningful along the way.
